## Code

* ### EO Unlocked: Metadata Search Engine for Earth Observation
  > User-centric innovation for Earth Observation, seeking to increase market transparency through “big metadata” analysis. Uses space situational awareness data from Celestrak, propagated via SGP4, and made searchable using an R-Tree spatial index. Search and filtering GUI developed in React and ThreeJS with the use of [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) for supplemental weather data.

* ### Wingman: Hazard Detection and Warning System for Cyclists 
  >A low-cost computer vision-based real-time hazard detection system for cyclists, empowering riders with enhanced situational awareness at 10% of the cost of leading LIDAR solutions. Uses Kivy (mobile app GUI), the Arduino ESP32-CAM microcontroller (for rearward-facing video acquisition), and Python ML backend for object detection and classification using TensorFlow Lite and the MobileNet model, and monocular distance estimation model trained using the [KITTI Vision Dataset](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) via XGBoost using an implementation from the [DisNet 2018 Paper](https://project.inria.fr/ppniv18/files/2018/10/paper22.pdf).

* ### NashCalc: The Most Intuitive Way to Game Theorize
  >An intuitive interface designed to improve accessibility to and interactivity with algorithmic game theory libraries through modern web frameworks, reducing the field’s barriers to entry for students and researchers alike. Functional for two-player standard form games of NxN dimensions.

  >Low-latency profanity filter that uses the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API with PyAudio and Python multiprocessing.
  
## Publications
[**_CSS Enterprise, Feasibility Study for a Commercial Space Station in Low Earth Orbit: Promising Onboard Activities_** (ISU, 2023)](https://isulibrary.isunet.edu/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=11819)

>This study offers a roadmap for future business opportunities and practical recommendations for diverse activities, demands, and possibilities in a commercial space station (CSS) during the 2020s and beyond. Understanding the financial and economic sustainability of a CSS will shape the future of space exploration and open doors for space-based research, in-space manufacturing, space tourism, and other profitable ventures. Therefore, this study can help commercial space entities to exploit emerging opportunities and encourage space agencies to expand their activities and optimize their allocations of resources.


[**_The Role of Space During Pandemics_** (ISU, 2020)](https://isulibrary.isunet.edu/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=11027#)

>The International Space University’s 2020 Interactive Space Program was unprecedented - the first program of its kind tasked with tackling a global challenge online, utilizing the resources of an international community of 86 crew members from 20 countries. Spread across time zones, working remotely, and collaborating online, crew members have split into three crew habitats to investigate and report on innovative space-based applications and resources so that humanity can better prevent, monitor, mitigate, and prepare for future pandemics.
