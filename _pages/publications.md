[**_CSS Enterprise, Feasibility Study for a Commercial Space Station in Low Earth Orbit: Promising Onboard Activities_** (ISU, 2023)](https://isulibrary.isunet.edu/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=11819)

>This study offers a roadmap for future business opportunities and practical recommendations for diverse activities, demands, and possibilities in a commercial space station (CSS) during the 2020s and beyond. Understanding the financial and economic sustainability of a CSS will shape the future of space exploration and open doors for space-based research, in-space manufacturing, space tourism, and other profitable ventures. Therefore, this study can help commercial space entities to exploit emerging opportunities and encourage space agencies to expand their activities and optimize their allocations of resources.

[**_The Role of Space During Pandemics_** (ISU, 2020)](https://isulibrary.isunet.edu/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=11027#)

>The International Space Universityâ€™s 2020 Interactive Space Program was unprecedented - the first program of its kind tasked with tackling a global challenge online, utilizing the resources of an international community of 86 crew members from 20 countries. Spread across time zones, working remotely, and collaborating online, crew members have split into three crew habitats to investigate and report on innovative space-based applications and resources so that humanity can better prevent, monitor, mitigate, and prepare for future pandemics.
